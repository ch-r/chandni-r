I'm a designer, I enjoy teaching computers to play better with people. 

About a decade back, I studied architecture. The building kind. Then I designed **retail stores** for a jewellery brand for a few years. My work hovered somewhere between *average* to *mildly remarkable*. But when I discovered human computer interaction design, I knew I'd come home. 

I went on to study HCI at IIT Bombay (2015-17), where I had the chance to indulge the restless tinkerer, the intuitive problem solver, and the curious collaborator in me. 

Right now, I lead **Tactopus**, a small ed-tech startup with big goals- to create accessible and inclusive learning aids for children with vision impairment. We are a team of 12, funded by Social Alpha, and our products are in 300+ schools, libraries, resource centres and homes - helping children learn through multi-sensory play. 

I founded Tactopus during my masters program in HCI, where it was effectively me and a wooden contraption powered by Processing (P5), with promise of future ability to dazzle. Now, it is an inspiring, able, driven, team who are actively developing innovative products, working closely with educators and beneficiaries, redefining what learning can be for children with disabilities.

The organisation is growing steadily, and has solid leadership to take it forward. After having spent 4 years thinking about little other than Tactopus, I'm ready to explore other challenges, find my next set of problems to work on. 

The best way to get to know me is to talk to me, of course, but here's some of my work you can go through. It's sometimes frightening just how much one's work is a reflection of oneself, and maybe looking at my work is an even better way to learn about me.
